This sample illustrates a simple LLVM IR -> PTX compiler implemented using
libNVVM. All command-line options are passed along to libNVVM. Arguments that
start with '-' are assumed to be options and are passed along accordingly.
Otherwise, options are treated as file names and are read as IR input(s). All
inputs will be linked together into a final PTX module.

NOTE: If you get errors about not being able to load libnvvm, please make sure
your [DY]LD_LIBRARY_PATH/PATH environment variable points to the libnvvm binary
in your CUDA installation, e.g.

  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.5/nvvm/lib64
